          “escape hatch”
        </a>
        : you use them when you need to “step outside React” and when there is
        no better built-in solution for your use case. If you find yourself
        often needing to manually write Effects, it’s usually a sign that you
        need to extract some

        </a>
        for common behaviors your components rely on.
